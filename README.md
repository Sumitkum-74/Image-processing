# Image-processing
The image_processing_toolbox is a Python repository dedicated to basic image processing techniques. It leverages the Canny edge detector, grayscale conversion, and noise reduction to enhance and analyze images. The project includes sample images from the CT University , providing a practical demonstration of the implemented techniques.

# steps for image processing 
firstly import open cv library of python
then collecting all images of ct university
and converting into it in grayscale 
and reducing the noise of images 
then detecting edges in x-axis
and also detecting edges in y-axis
then combining it and getting all the edges of images

# Conclusion 
Bu combining sobel-x and sobel-y we get effective edges of all images .
